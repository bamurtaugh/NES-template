# Changing Intent

This folder contains sample code files for demonstrating scenarios where the intent or purpose of code needs to be changed.

## Files

- **geometry.ts** - A TypeScript Point class that calculates distance from origin
- **stats.cpp** - A C++ Statistics class that computes statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, min) from a collection of samples

## Purpose

These files serve as examples for practicing code modifications that involve changing the original intent or purpose of the implementation.
