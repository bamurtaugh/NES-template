# Fuller NES Examples

This folder contains comprehensive, full-featured application examples that demonstrate advanced GitHub Copilot Next Edit Suggestions (NES) scenarios across multiple files and complex codebases.

## Project

### Task Manager App
A feature-rich task manager built with React and TypeScript that showcases how NES can help with real-world development tasks. This application includes:

- Complex component hierarchies
- State management with React Context
- Custom hooks for filtering and sorting
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Multiple interconnected files

The example demonstrates how NES can suggest contextual edits across:
- Component files (`TaskForm.tsx`, `TaskItem.tsx`, `TaskList.tsx`)
- Type definitions (`task.ts`)
- Custom hooks (`useTaskFilters.ts`)
- Context providers (`TaskContext.tsx`)

## Getting Started

Navigate to the `task-manager-app` directory for detailed instructions on running the application and trying out the NES scenarios.

## About This Example

This represents the most complex scenario in the NES template repository, showing how Copilot's suggestions can span multiple files and help maintain consistency across a larger codebase.
