# Changing & Fixing Logic Examples

This folder demonstrates scenarios where you need to modify, improve, or fix existing logic using GitHub Copilot's Next Edit Suggestions (NES).

## Examples

### scenarios.ts
TypeScript functions showcasing common programming patterns that might need modifications:
- Optional and default parameters
- Arrow functions vs regular functions
- Algorithm improvements (prime number checking)

**Try this scenario:**
- Optimize the `isPrime` function for better performance
- Add input validation to the functions
- Convert functions to use different parameter patterns
- Add error handling for edge cases

### js-game/
A JavaScript word guessing game (similar to Wordle) that demonstrates fixing game logic:
- Game mechanics and rules
- Player input validation
- Win/lose condition handling
- Random word selection logic

**Try this scenario:**
- Fix the letter checking algorithm for better accuracy
- Improve the scoring system
- Add validation for invalid inputs
- Optimize the word comparison logic

## About This Category

These examples focus on scenarios where existing code has bugs, performance issues, or could be improved. NES can help identify patterns in your fixes and suggest similar improvements throughout your codebase, making debugging and optimization more efficient.
