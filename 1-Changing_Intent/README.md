# Changing Intent Examples

This folder demonstrates scenarios where you want to change the purpose or intent of existing code using GitHub Copilot's Next Edit Suggestions (NES).

## Examples

### geometry.ts
A TypeScript class demonstrating geometric calculations. This example shows how NES can suggest changes when you modify the purpose of methods or add new functionality to existing classes.

**Try this scenario:**
- Modify the `getDistance()` method to calculate distance from another point instead of from origin
- Add new methods for area calculations  
- Change the class to support 3D coordinates

### stats.cpp
A C++ statistics class with methods for calculating statistical measures. This example demonstrates how NES can help when changing the mathematical algorithms or adding new statistical functions.

**Try this scenario:**
- Modify the standard deviation calculation method
- Add median and mode calculations
- Change the data structure used for storing samples

## About This Category

These examples focus on scenarios where you're not just adding new code, but fundamentally changing what existing code does. NES can help maintain consistency and suggest appropriate modifications throughout your codebase when the intent changes.
