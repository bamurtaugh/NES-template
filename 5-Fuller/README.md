# 5-Fuller: Advanced Copilot Next Edit Suggestions Example

This folder contains a more comprehensive and feature-rich example for demonstrating Copilot Next Edit Suggestions (NES) capabilities with a real-world application.

## Contents

### Task Manager App

A full-featured task management application built with React and TypeScript. This example demonstrates how NES can assist with complex, multi-file refactoring scenarios in a realistic codebase.

The Task Manager App includes:
- React components with TypeScript
- Context API for state management
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Multiple interaction scenarios for testing NES capabilities

See the [Task Manager App README](task-manager-app/README.md) for detailed usage instructions and specific scenarios to try with Copilot Next Edit Suggestions.

## Purpose

This example is designed to showcase NES in a fuller, more realistic development context compared to simpler examples. It demonstrates how NES can:
- Propagate changes across multiple related files
- Suggest refactoring patterns in larger codebases
- Handle complex type updates and interface changes
- Work with modern React patterns and TypeScript
