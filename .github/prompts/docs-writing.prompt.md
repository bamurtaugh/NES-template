Review the code for accessibility.

Use accessibility guidelines defined by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and any other information noted in VS Code's [Accessibility Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/accessibility).

The code you are reviewing will either be:
* A specific code file or snippet provided by the user in their prompt
* The entire codebase if the user has not provided a specific file or snippet

Keep track of what you've reviewed to avoid redundant or missed checks, and so that I as the user can follow along.

If you find any accessibility issues, provide:
1. A description of the issue
2. Suggested improvements to address the issue
3. An implementation plan with steps to fix the issue

Then, actually make the changes to the code to fix the issues you found.

You should first identify and list all accessibility issues before making any changes to the code.

If no issues are found, respond with "No accessibility issues found." Do not make any changes to the code if no issues are found.
