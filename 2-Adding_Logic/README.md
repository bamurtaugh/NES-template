# 2-Adding_Logic

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to add new logic and functionality to existing codebases with AI assistance.

## Examples

### Python Game (game.py)
A two-player guessing game that demonstrates:
- Interactive gameplay logic
- Player management
- Win condition checking
- Game state management

### VS Code Extension Sample (extension-sample/)
A complete VS Code extension example showing:
- Extension development patterns
- Command registration and handling
- VS Code API integration
- Development container setup
- TypeScript configuration

## Usage

These examples showcase how AI can help you:
- Add new features to existing applications
- Implement game logic and user interactions
- Extend functionality with new methods and classes
- Integrate with external APIs and frameworks
- Set up development environments and tooling

Try using GitHub Copilot to:
- Add new game modes to the Python game
- Extend the VS Code extension with additional commands
- Implement new player features or scoring systems
- Add error handling and validation logic

Each example provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional functionality using AI assistance.
